### **🐾My path on the github begins on March 17, 2021🐾**
# **👋Hi, I’m aceman1209**
### **My real name is Artem Abramov. I'm an amateur developer. I started learning programming languages and writing my programs in 2015. At the moment I stopped at Java and Minecraft mod development. My English isn't as good as I would like it to be, so I have to use a translator.**

## **👀 Programming languages that I have learned, am learning or will learn**
- C# - started with this. I don't know the latest updates, but I can write average code without much trouble, will probably use google or docs. Learned the concept of object-oriented programming in this language.
- Java - my current language. I use Java 8. I know a few tricks and the concept of how the code works, but I don't think I know enough to call myself a professional. I use this language most of the time to Minecraft mod development.
- PHP - my attempt to come to web development. Right now there are no completed projects, not even training projects.
- Python - ren'py development. Attempts to port novellas and a few attempts to write my own. At the moment only one project is finished.
- Lua - only in opencomputers mod. Almost never used standalone.
- C++ - very little experience on linux and at university. A simple graphical tablet driver with coordinate mapping was written on linux, but it has a lot of bugs. There were few tasks at the university and they were all simple.
- Visual Basic - attempts at medium school. It's obsolete now and I don't use it.
